# Linear-Regression-Visualization
This repository helps to visualize learning of Linear Regression algorithm in machine learning. By changing the value of learning rate in gradient descent algorithm, corresponding changes in cost function J(Î¸) are plotted to see the convergence rate. From the graphs obtained differenet values of learning rates are compared and best value is chosen for efficient implementation.

For smaller smaller training set, instead of gradient descend algorithm normalised eqution approach can also be used for finding parameters.
