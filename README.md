# Linear-Regression-Visualization
This repository helps to visualization learning of Linear Regression algorithm. By changing the value of learning rate and no. of iteration corresponding changes in cost function J(Î¸) are plotted to see convergence rate. Best value of learning rate can then be chosen for quick implementation.
